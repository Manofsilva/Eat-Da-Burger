# Eat-Da-Burger

*Eat-Da-Burger! is a restaurant app that lets users input the names of burgers they'd like to eat.

*Whenever a user submits a burger's name, the app will display the burger on the top of the page -- waiting to be devoured.

*Each burger in the waiting area also has a Devour it! button. When the user clicks it, the burger will move to the middle of the page.

*The app will store every burger in a MySQL database, whether devoured or not.

*The app uses express for Node.js and it's hosted on heroku here:
